# Running "bazel build :vscode" will download the needed files to allow it to work.

# C/C++ external headers will need to be added to the srcs list of the below filegroup, as well as any external java
# dependencies not downloaded through maven_install

# Additionally, if any additional maven_install targets are added in the future to support additional maven repositories,
# they will need to be added to the "maven_genfile_targets" variable.

# Makes use of downloaded files that have been copied to genfiles so that they are all in one place and don't get
# erased when a build is run on a target that doesn't depend on a specific library.
# For more info about this, see the comments in both of the files that are loaded below.
